When implementing the interface. there was a problem with the getFormattedDate()
method, because it was static.
It gives an issue where all other methods that used it need to be static.

isStringValid
When there is not written public/private/protected before a method name
it will be package protected and can not be seen in the test classes.
making it 

coverage
We get little coverage on our different joketypes.
The reason for the is that we mock them, so we dont actually use them.

JUnit
JUnit is a unit framework to unit test in Java.

Mockito
Mockito is a mocking framework, which makes it very easy to mock away dependencies

Hamcrest
Hamcrest is a different matcher tool used in tests.
making the tests more "readable", in that way the test can be more like "normal" english.

Jacoco
Jacoco gives an overview over the lines of code that are executed during
tests. 
And as an added bonus highlight them so you easily can see it.
As a general note you should strive for 80% coverage.
I only hit ~50% so i am a bit behind..

Most of these tools and tools like them will have a maven plugin / dependency
making it extremely easy to setup across multiple pc'es, using Maven.

can be done by doing something like this:
<dependency>
   <groupId>junit</groupId>
   <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
   <version>4.12</version>
   <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
